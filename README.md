#Podio
A inf1510 project at the University of Oslo aming to combine radio and podcast in a physical object that is easy to use for the elderly. 
For this functionality we use a Raspberry pi B and an Arduino Uno - communicating via USB serial. The Arduino is connected to a Sparkfun RFID evaluation shield (13.56 Mhz) that processes and reads RFID-tags.
Podio starts playing a radiostation or podcast when a rfid is presented, and stops when it is no longer in range.
